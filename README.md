This project implements a complete ESP32-based quadcopter flight controller designed for a 450-size drone frame. The system uses an MPU gyroscope–accelerometer for attitude estimation and supports angle mode stabilization using PID control.

The firmware includes modules for motor calibration, receiver PWM input, IMU calibration, battery voltage monitoring, and real-time PID tuning through a web server. Complete hardware documentation such as schematics, BOM, and circuit diagrams are also provided.

This project demonstrates practical skills in embedded systems, control systems, ESP32 programming, and drone flight dynamics.
